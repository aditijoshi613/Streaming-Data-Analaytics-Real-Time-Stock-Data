## Overview
Citi Group acquired Best Buyâ€™s credit card portfolio business a few years ago and hence, we wanted to analyze the real-time patterns in the time series of their stock prices. This would inform traders about any anomalies/ their gains and losses etc in real-time that would help them make informed decisions on both the stocks.

Through this project, We attempt to provide real-time stock information through line charts in PowerBI. We further built intraday correlations between two time series considering the latest time series.

We have performed this end-to-end analysis using Python for gathering data from Finnhub and Yahoo Finance APIs, Azure IoTHub, Azure blob storage, and Power BI for analysis
